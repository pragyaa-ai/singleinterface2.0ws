# ✅ Waybeo Format Analysis

## 📋 Format Specification (From Waybeo)

```json
{
  "event": "media",
  "type": "media",
  "ucid": "<bridgeId>",
  "data": {
    "samples": [ /* signed integers, PCM16LE */ ],
    "bitsPerSample": 16,
    "sampleRate": 8000,
    "channelCount": 1,
    "numberOfFrames": <N>,
    "type": "data"
  }
}
```

### ✅ Verdict: **FORMAT IS CORRECT!**

| Parameter | Expected | Waybeo | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|--------|
| Sample Rate | 8000 Hz | 8000 Hz | ✅ Match |
| Bits Per Sample | 16 | 16 | ✅ Match |
| Channels | 1 (mono) | 1 | ✅ Match |
| Format | PCM16LE signed | PCM16LE signed | ✅ Match |

**This matches Ozonetel's format perfectly!**

## 🤔 Then Why Garbled Transcription?

### Symptoms:
```javascript
// From actual call logs:
Transcripts: [
  'بلش مهبا',                    // ❌ Arabic script (should be "Scorpio")
  'Yes.',                         // ✅ Works
  'gulshan.mehta at gmail.com',  // ✅ Works
  'Yes.',                         // ✅ Works
]
```

**Pattern:** Some words transcribe correctly, others are completely wrong.

## 🔍 Possible Issues (Despite Correct Format)

### 1. **Unsigned Instead of Signed** (Most Likely)
**Symptom:** Garbled/distorted audio
**Issue:** They claim "signed integers" but actually sending unsigned
**Detection:** 
- Signed: Range -32768 to 32767
- Unsigned: Range 0 to 65535

**If unsigned but treated as signed:**
- Values 32768-65535 become negative (-32768 to -1)
- Creates DC offset and distortion
- Results in poor transcription

**Fix:** Tell Waybeo to ensure ACTUAL sample values are signed

---

### 2. **Endianness Reversed**
**Symptom:** Very noisy/static audio
**Issue:** They say "LE" (little-endian) but sending big-endian
**Detection:** Audio sounds like static or noise

**Example:**
```
Little-endian: [0x00, 0x01] = 256
Big-endian:    [0x00, 0x01] = 1
```

**Fix:** Verify byte order is little-endian (least significant byte first)

---

### 3. **Volume/Gain Issues**
**Symptom:** Some words work, others don't
**Issue:** Audio too quiet or too loud for certain sounds
**Detection:** Check min/max sample values

**Expected range usage:**
- Quiet speech: ±2000 to ±8000
- Normal speech: ±8000 to ±20000
- Loud speech: ±20000 to ±32000

**If samples are consistently < ±1000:** Audio too quiet
**If samples hit ±32767 frequently:** Audio clipping (too loud)

**Fix:** Adjust gain/volume on Waybeo's side

---

### 4. **Packet Loss/Jitter**
**Symptom:** Intermittent transcription issues
**Issue:** Audio packets arriving out of order or dropped
**Detection:** Check for gaps in conversation

**Fix:** Check network quality, UDP packet loss

---

### 5. **Audio Processing Artifacts**
**Symptom:** Certain phonemes misheard
**Issue:** Waybeo might be applying noise reduction/echo cancellation that degrades quality
**Detection:** Compare raw audio quality

**Fix:** Ask Waybeo to send unprocessed/raw audio

## 🔬 Enhanced Diagnostic Results

After deploying the enhanced diagnostic code, make a test call with Waybeo.

### You'll see output like:

```
================================================================================
[CALL_ID] 🎵 AUDIO FORMAT DIAGNOSTIC (First Packet)
[CALL_ID] Sample Rate: 8000 Hz
[CALL_ID] Bits Per Sample: 16
[CALL_ID] Channels: 1
[CALL_ID] Number of Samples: 80
[CALL_ID] Expected: 8000 Hz, 16-bit, Mono, ~80 samples per frame

[CALL_ID] 🔢 Sample Analysis:
[CALL_ID]   - First 10 samples: [123, -456, 789, -1234, ...]
[CALL_ID]   - Has negative values: YES (signed ✅)
[CALL_ID]   - Min value: -15234
[CALL_ID]   - Max value: 14567
[CALL_ID]   - Expected range: -32768 to 32767 (signed 16-bit)
================================================================================
```

### What to Check:

#### ✅ **Good Signs:**
```
Has negative values: YES (signed ✅)
Min value: -15234    (reasonable)
Max value: 14567     (reasonable)
First 10 samples: [123, -456, 789, -1234, ...]  (mix of positive/negative)
```

#### ❌ **Bad Signs:**

**Unsigned integers:**
```
Has negative values: NO (unsigned ❌)
Min value: 0
Max value: 55234
First 10 samples: [32123, 33456, 34789, ...]  (all positive, high values)
⚠️ WARNING: Appears to be unsigned 16-bit (0-65535)!
```

**Too quiet:**
```
Has negative values: YES (signed ✅)
Min value: -234      (very small)
Max value: 189       (very small)
First 10 samples: [23, -45, 78, -123, ...]  (all small values)
```

**Clipping (too loud):**
```
Has negative values: YES (signed ✅)
Min value: -32768    (hit limit!)
Max value: 32767     (hit limit!)
First 10 samples: [32767, -32768, 32767, -32768, ...]  (hitting limits)
```

  - First 10: [456, -789, 234, -567, ...]
Transcription: Perfect ✅
```

**Waybeo (Issues):**
```

## 🚀 Action Plan

### Step 1: Deploy Enhanced Diagnostic
```bash
cd /opt/voiceagent
git pull origin main
pm2 restart voiceagent-telephony
```

### Step 2: Make Test Calls
```bash
pm2 logs voiceagent-telephony --lines 0
```

Make calls with BOTH:
1. **Ozonetel** (working baseline)
2. **Waybeo** (problematic)

### Step 3: Compare Diagnostic Output

Look for differences in:
- Sample value ranges
- Signed vs unsigned
- Min/max values
- Sample patterns

### Step 4: Contact Waybeo with Specific Issue

**Example message based on findings:**

If unsigned detected:
> "Your spec says 'signed integers, PCM16LE' but actual sample values 
> suggest unsigned integers (all positive, 0-65535 range).
> 
> Please verify samples are signed 16-bit integers (-32768 to 32767)."

If volume too low:
> "Audio samples are very small (±200 range instead of ±10000).
> Audio is too quiet. Please increase gain/volume by ~40dB."

If clipping:
> "Audio samples are hitting limits (32767/-32768 frequently).
> Audio is clipping. Please reduce gain/volume by ~20dB."

## ✅ Expected Resolution

Once Waybeo fixes the actual audio data issue:

**Before:**
```
User says: "Scorpio"
Audio samples: [incorrect format/volume]
Transcription: "بلش مهبا" ❌
```

**After:**
```
User says: "Scorpio"
Audio samples: [correct signed 16-bit, proper volume]
Transcription: "Scorpio" ✅
```
